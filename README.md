<h1>About me</h1>

Mainly a Godot Game Developer, I do some pixel art occasionally but I love writing shaders in Godot. (Its kinda like simplified GLSL)

My programming Language of choice is **Python** üêç

Its just so easy to create advanced programs using modules, and not having to include a bunch of library files or anything but just a simple "import" keyword

Especially useful for coding random \**** at 3AM

```python
from my_brain import braincells

def why_am_i_up_this_late(braincells):
  if len(braincells) < 1:
    print("bro save meee")
```

Here's a program I made using Python that might help any GCSE students (*wink wink* dont tell anybody hehe): https://github.com/nekotogd/UMS_Finder
